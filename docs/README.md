## Note

**Keep the main README.md concise.** When adding new documentation, consider:
- Is this essential for getting started? → Keep in main README
- Is this detailed reference material? → Move to `docs/` folder
- Is this troubleshooting or advanced usage? → Move to `docs/` folder

This structure helps maintain a clean, scannable main README while preserving all important information in organized documentation files.
